Sample 4 - Host List Detection CSV Output with Truncation

A truncated response is returned when the API request returns more host records than the truncation limit - in this case the limit is set to 2. 
curl -u "username:password" -H "X-Requested-With: curl"
"https://qualysapi.qualys.com/api/2.0/fo/asset/host/vm/detection/?action=list&output_format=CSV&truncation_limit=2"

The FOOTER_CSV section in the output (shown below) indicates the URL you need to use to request the next 2 host records.
