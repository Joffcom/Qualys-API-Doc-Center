Important Note: The regular expression string you provide in the “os_pattern” parameter must follow the PCRE standard and it must be URL encoded to make sure that special characters are correctly passed to the filter.
OS Name “Beginning With”
To list hosts in the range 10.10.10.1-10.10.10.100 which have an operating system beginning with “Windows”, you can use the following URL:
https://qualysapi.qualys.com/api/2.0/fo/asset/host/vm/detection/?action=list&ips=10.10.10.1-10.10.10.100&os_pattern=%5EWindows

where “%5EWindows” is the URL encoded version of the PCRE regular expression “^Windows”. Any host which was scanned for vulnerabilities and which has an operating system starting with “Windows” will be included in the host list output.
OS Name “Ending With”
To list hosts in the range 10.10.10.1-10.10.10.100 which have the operating system name “FreeBSD”, you can use the following URL:
https://qualysapi.qualys.com/api/2.0/fo/asset/host/vm/detection/?action=list&ips=10.10.10.1-10.10.10.100&os_pattern=BSD%24

where “BSD%24” is the URL encoded version of the PCRE regular expression “BSD$”. For the above sample, hosts which are in the range 10.10.10.1-10.10.10.100 and which have an operating system ending in BSD, such as FreeBSD, will be included in the host list output.
OS Name with Simple Pattern
To list hosts which have an operating system name containing “2003” you can use the following URL:
https://qualysapi.qualys.com/api/2.0/fo/asset/host/vm/detection/?action=list&os_pattern=2003

Any host which was scanned for vulnerabilities and which has an operating system including the string “2003” will be included in the host list output.
OS Name with More Complex Pattern
To list hosts in the range 10.10.10.1-10.10.10.100 which have an operating system name containing a more complex string like “Windows 64 bit” you could use the OS pattern shown in the following URL:
https://qualysapi.qualys.com/api/2.0/fo/asset/host/vm/detection/?action=list&ips=10.10.10.1-10.10.10.100&os_pattern=%5EWin.*64%20bit.*Service%20Pack%201%24

where “%5EWin.*64%20bit.*Service%20Pack%201%24” is the URL encoded version of the PCRE regular expression “^Win.*64+bit.*Service+Pack+1”. The above regular expression matches OS string starting with “Win”, containing “64 bit” and ending with “Service Pack 1”. Possible matches include hosts in the range 10.10.10.1-10.10.10.100 which have some flavors of Windows 64 Bit Service Pack 1 such as these:
Windows XP 64 bit Edition Service Pack 1
Windows 2008 Core 64 bit Edition Service Pack 1
Windows 2003 Server 64 bit Edition AD Service Pack 1
Hosts with No OS
To list hosts with no operating system defined, you can use the following URL:
https://qualysapi.qualys.com/api/2.0/fo/asset/host/vm/detection/?action=list&ips=10.10.10.1-10.10.10.100&os_pattern=%5E%24

where “%5E%24” is the URL encoded version of the PCRE regular expression “^$”. The above request will list all hosts in the user account that do not have an operating system defined.
