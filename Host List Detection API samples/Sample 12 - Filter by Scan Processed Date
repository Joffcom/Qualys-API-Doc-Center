Request a list of hosts with vulnerability scan results processed before or after a certain date/time. Use the “vm_processed_before” and “vm_processed_after” parameters.
Return hosts with vulnerability scans processed after November 5th: 
curl -u "username:password" -H "X-Requested-With: curl" "https://qualysapi.qualys.com/api/2.0/fo/asset/host/vm/detection/?action=list&vm_processed_after=2016-11-05"

You can also use these date filters together:
curl -u "username:password" -H "X-Requested-With: curl" "https://qualysapi.qualys.com/api/2.0/fo/asset/host/vm/detection/?action=list&vm_processed_after=2016-11-05&vm_processed_before=2016-12-31"
